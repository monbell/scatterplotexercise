## Goals for this exercise:

Design and implement an interface for plotting loan data. Allow the user to save plots in a dashboard.

## Details:
Create a page that allows the user to generate scatter plots that compare any pair of columns in the dataset. Allow the user to save plots. Create a dashboard page that displays saved plots in a grid:

* The number of columns in the grid should change with the width of the page.
* The size of each plot should change with the width of the page.

Avoid using libraries that solve too much of the problem. A library that calculates the grid layout plots is not allowed, for example. It's ok (even preferred) if you use a plotting library.

After you implement the basic requirements of the exercise, consider some ways in which you might extend the functionality of the application:

* Allow the user to delete plots from the dashboard.
* Allow the user to rearrange plot positions in the grid by dragging with the mouse.
* Allow the user to expand and collapse a plot within the grid.
* Allow the user to edit existing plots.
* Allow the user to create multiple dashboards.
* Allow the user to merge saved plots in a new plot.
* Allow the user to filter data points from scatter plots.
* Allow the user to search the plot grid.

## README:
Include a README that answers the following questions:

* How much time did you spend on the assignment?
* If you used a plotting library, why did you choose it?
* What do you like about your implementation?
* If you were to restart, what would you change about your implementation?
* If you were given more time, how would you test your project?

If you didn't use the starter code, please include instructions on how to build and run your project. It's very important that we can see and interact with your submission during our evaluation process.

What we want to see in your submission:

* Clean, maintainable code.
* Short, helpful comments.
* A sensible user experience.
* Responsive UI.

## Starter code:

To use the starter code: navigate to this project directory, run `npm install` to install dependencies (this takes a couple minutes), and then run `npm start` to initialize and connect to a node server with your default browser. Use as much or as little of the starter code as you'd like.

## Sample data:

The "src/loanData.js" file contains peer-to-peer loan data you are required to use in this exercise
